### About Cloudflare and Singularity
Singularity uses [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) to bypass Cloudflare protections, by making too much requests your IP address could be blocked by Cloudflare for 24 hours or even more. This can be circunvented by restarting your router if you have a dynamic address, using a proxy / VPN or using a captcha recognition service. If you can't use any of the before mentioned circunventions you will have to wait to use Singularity with that streaming service again.
